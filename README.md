### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an FFXI Organizer application with Java and Spring Boot.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™ve just completed Promineo Tech's Back-End Development Boot Camp, and now I'm trying to practice my skills.
I'm finishing up a couple of old courses I signed up for and never finished because I didn't have enough background knowledge.
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for direction.
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my banana flute.
âš¡ Fun fact: My bachelor's degree is in trumpet performance.
