### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I liked back end boot camp so much that I have just recently begun the Promineo Tech Front End Developer boot camp.
ðŸ”­ Current side projects: a portfolio-style website using JS, CSS, and HTML, and an FFXI gear organizer application with Java and Spring Boot.
ðŸŒ± I completed Promineo Tech's Back-End Development Boot Camp in January, and did a few short certificate classes online to prepare for the front end.
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for direction and maybe a sign.
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my banana flute.
âš¡ Fun fact: My bachelor's degree is in trumpet performance.
