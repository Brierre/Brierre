### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have now graduated from both front-end and back-end software development bootcamps. I still just feel like Heather.

ðŸ”­ Current side projects: I turned in my final project for front end this week, but it has a lot of work to go to be complete: K04 Army Builder needs a lot of styling,
and a points calculator for building an army. I would also like to port it over from mockapi to a real SQL database so my kids can use the app.
I am also going to be working on a portfolio-style site. For now I have one in the works, but it barely showcases my work.
Adding a front-end to Rehearsal Scheduler (and picking a musical for March 2024) is on the list, too. 
For next summer, I want to create a dot book app for my marching band kids to use.

ðŸŒ± I completed Promineo Tech's Back-End Development Boot Camp in January, a few short classes in front end, and the Front-End Boot Camp in August. Life is good!
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for direction and maybe a sign. I go back to school in a week, in one building this year, with four new classes to teach, and a new principal.
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my banana flute.
âš¡ Fun fact: My bachelor's degree is in trumpet performance.
