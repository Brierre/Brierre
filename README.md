### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have now graduated from both front-end and back-end software development bootcamps. I still just feel like Heather.

ðŸ”­ Next up projects: For next summer, I want to create a dot book app for my marching band kids to use. I am starting grad school in January, directing 
the pit and coordinating Mary Poppins at my high school in March, and still have to write the marching band show for band camp in July, so software development 
is going to be light this year. I'm still working on my portfolio website, and purchased a domain https://whatsthehapps.dev/ for use by myself and my son, who 
just graduated in comp sci in May. I hope between the two of us we can come up with and implement some great ideas.

ðŸŒ± I am still utilizing my software development skills to create tools that help music teachers, but it has been slow with all of my other responsibilities.
ðŸ¤” 
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my banana flute.
âš¡ My bachelor's degree is in trumpet performance. My masters will be in choral conducting from Messiah University. I hope to fill in some knowledge gaps!
